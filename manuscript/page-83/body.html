They entered into conversation, but the subject of it I could not hear. Presently Burch came down into the yard, unfettered me, and led me into one of the small houses.</p><p>"You told that man you came from New-York," said he.</p><p>I replied, "I told him I had been up as far as New-York, to be sure, but did not tell him I belonged there, nor that I was a freeman. I meant no harm at all, Master Burch. I would not have said it had I thought."</p><p>He looked at me a moment as if he was ready to devour me, then turning round went out. In a few  minutes he returned. "If ever I hear you say a word about New-York, or about your freedom, I will be the death of youâ€”I will kill you; you may rely on that," he ejaculated fiercely.</p></div> </div>
